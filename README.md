**SynLink** is an advanced bioinformatics tool for **syntenic block construction**, **ortholog mapping**, and **ancestral linkage group (ALG) estimation**. Leveraging a highly optimized algorithm to outperform DAGChainer, SynLink offers rapid synteny analysis across large genomic datasets, constructing networks that reveal conserved chromosomal arrangements. 

## Features

- **Efficient syntenic block construction:** Faster than DAGChainer with reduced computational overhead.
- **Ortholog network visualization:** Visualize chromosomal networks connected by orthologous links.
- **ALG estimation:** Generate ancestral linkage groups across species comparisons.
- **Highly parallel processing:** Optimized for large datasets with minimal resource usage.
- **Configurable output:** Customizable block sizes, distance thresholds, and filtering options.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Python 3.8+ and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SynLink.git
cd SynLink

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Quick Start
Place your ortholog mapping files (*_ortholog_mapping.txt) in the OrthologMapping folder.
Run the SynLink pipeline to generate syntenic blocks, visualize networks, and estimate ALGs.
Usage
bash
Copy code
python synlink.py [options]
Options
Argument	Default	Description
--min-block-size	3	Minimum number of genes in a syntenic block
--max-distance	2000000	Maximum allowable distance (in base pairs) between genes in a block
--min-genes	3	Minimum genes per block in the final output
--output	./output/	Output directory for syntenic block results
Example
bash
Copy code
python synlink.py --min-block-size 3 --max-distance 1000000 --output ./results/
Demo Files
A set of demo files is available in the demo/ directory to help you get started. After cloning the repository, you can run SynLink on these files to understand how it works and explore the results.

Output
SynLink generates various outputs including:

Syntenic Blocks: Identified blocks saved in the specified output directory.
Combined Synteny File: A comprehensive file summarizing syntenic relationships across species.
Network Visualization: Graph-based view of syntenic relationships (if visualization modules are installed).
